Every human on the planet shares the responsibility of preserving its resources (for other humans, other species, and for future generations). An individual can contribute to the prevention of deforestation by implementing the 3R (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle) principle in their daily lives.

Reduce – Reducing the amount of paper consumed by using alternatives wherever possible.
Reuse – Avoid use-and-throw products to prevent wastage
Recycle – Diligently recycle all used wood and paper products
